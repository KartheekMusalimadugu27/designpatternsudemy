FEATURES OF THE SINGLETON PATTERN

Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class for example a 
single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate 
DB connection for every object may be costly. Similarly, there can be a 
single configuration manager or error manager in an application that 
handles all problems instead of creating multiple managers.

Definition: 
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation
 of a class to one object.

- Prevents the instantiation of a class more than once
- Provides single access to an object

Usages:

DBConnections, Logger, Report, Threadpool, Cache etc.


Different Ways:

1. Classic Way
2. Lazy Intilization with Thread Safe
3. Eager Intilization
4. Double Checking Lazy Intilization and Thread safe
