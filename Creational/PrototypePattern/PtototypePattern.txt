FEATURES OF THE PROTOTYPE PATTERN

- Mainly used when the object creation costs you more memory.

- Creating new objects with Clone(), not New()
- Makes use of an interface (Clonable)
- Shallow cloning (Cloning only variables) vs deep cloning (Cloning the whole classs)
- Objects are still unique,even if they are copied

DisAdvantages:

- Not very clear when to use it
- Usually comes with other design patterns
- Increased complexity for creating a deep copy
